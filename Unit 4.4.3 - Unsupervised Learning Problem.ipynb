       " '\" Walter Elliot , born March 1 , 1760 , married , July 15 , 1784 , Elizabeth , daughter of James Stevenson , Esq .',\n",
       " 'Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer \\' s hands ; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding , for the information of himself and his family , these words , after the date of Mary \\' s birth  \" Married , December 16 , 1810 , Charles , son and heir of Charles Musgrove , Esq .',\n",
       " 'Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in Cheshire ; how mentioned in Dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of Charles II , with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto :\" Principal seat , Kellynch Hall , in the county of Somerset ,\" and Sir Walter \\' s handwriting again in this finale :',\n",
       " '\" Heir presumptive , William Walter Elliot , Esq ., great grandson of the second Sir Walter .\"',\n",
       " \"Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot ' s character ; vanity of person and of situation .\",\n",
       " 'His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment ; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own .',\n",
       " 'This friend , and Sir Walter , did not marry , whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance .',\n",
       " \"That Lady Russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again , than when she does not ; but Sir Walter ' s continuing in singleness requires explanation .\",\n",
       " 'To Lady Russell , indeed , she was a most dear and highly valued god - daughter , favourite , and friend .',\n",
       " 'A few years before , Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl , but her bloom had vanished early ; and as even in its height , her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ), there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem .',\n",
       " 'It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty - nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost .',\n",
       " 'Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment .',\n",
       " 'She had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of .',\n",
       " 'She had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should .',\n",
       " 'He was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed .',\n",
       " 'Sir Walter has resented it .',\n",
       " \"This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still , after an interval of several years , felt with anger by Elizabeth , who had liked the man for himself , and still more for being her father ' s heir , and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot ' s eldest daughter .\",\n",
       " \"Such were Elizabeth Elliot ' s sentiments and sensations ; such the cares to alloy , the agitations to vary , the sameness and the elegance , the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life ; such the feelings to give interest to a long , uneventful residence in one country circle , to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad , no talents or accomplishments for home , to occupy .\",\n",
       " 'But now , another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these .',\n",
       " 'There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of ; but had every acre been alienable , it would have made no difference .',\n",
       " 'Their two confidential friends , Mr Shepherd , who lived in the neighbouring market town , and Lady Russell , were called to advise them ; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure , without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride .',\n",
       " 'Chapter 2',\n",
       " 'Mr Shepherd , a civil , cautious lawyer , who , whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter , would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else , excused himself from offering the slightest hint , and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell , from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted .',\n",
       " 'Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject , and gave it much serious consideration .',\n",
       " 'They must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt .',\n",
       " '\" If we can persuade your father to all this ,\" said Lady Russell , looking over her paper , \" much may be done .',\n",
       " 'This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him .',\n",
       " \"How Anne ' s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence .\",\n",
       " '\" Quit Kellynch Hall .\"',\n",
       " 'Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall ; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision , the great question of whither he should go was settled , and the first outline of this important change made out .',\n",
       " 'There had been three alternatives , London , Bath , or another house in the country .',\n",
       " 'Sir Walter had at first thought more of London ; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred .',\n",
       " \"Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne ' s known wishes .\",\n",
       " \"Lady Russell was fond of Bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend ' s health , by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good .\",\n",
       " 'The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part , and a very material part of the scheme , which had been happily engrafted on the beginning .',\n",
       " 'Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house .',\n",
       " 'How quick come the reasons for approving what we like !',\n",
       " 'Lady Russell , indeed , had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth , and seemed to love her , rather because she would love her , than because Elizabeth deserved it .',\n",
       " \"From situation , Mrs Clay was , in Lady Russell ' s estimate , a very unequal , and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion ; and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind , and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot ' s reach , was therefore an object of first - rate importance .\",\n",
       " 'Chapter 3',\n",
       " '\" I must take leave to observe , Sir Walter ,\" said Mr Shepherd one morning at Kellynch Hall , as he laid down the newspaper , \" that the present juncture is much in our favour .',\n",
       " '\" He would be a very lucky man , Shepherd ,\" replied Sir Walter ; \" that \\' s all I have to remark .',\n",
       " 'Mr Shepherd laughed , as he knew he must , at this wit , and then added ',\n",
       " '\" I presume to observe , Sir Walter , that , in the way of business , gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with .',\n",
       " 'Sir Walter only nodded .',\n",
       " '\" There are few among the gentlemen of the navy , I imagine , who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description .\"',\n",
       " '\" They would look around them , no doubt , and bless their good fortune ,\" said Mrs Clay , for Mrs Clay was present : her father had driven her over , nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay \\' s health as a drive to Kellynch : \" but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant .',\n",
       " '\" As to all that ,\" rejoined Sir Walter coolly , \" supposing I were induced to let my house , I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it .',\n",
       " 'After a short pause , Mr Shepherd presumed to say ',\n",
       " '\" In all these cases , there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant .',\n",
       " 'Here Anne spoke ',\n",
       " '\" The navy , I think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give .',\n",
       " '\" Very true , very true .',\n",
       " '\" The profession has its utility , but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it .\"',\n",
       " '\" Indeed !\"',\n",
       " '\" Yes ; it is in two points offensive to me ; I have two strong grounds of objection to it .',\n",
       " '\" Nay , Sir Walter ,\" cried Mrs Clay , \" this is being severe indeed .',\n",
       " \"It seemed as if Mr Shepherd , in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter ' s good will towards a naval officer as tenant , had been gifted with foresight ; for the very first application for the house was from an Admiral Croft , with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton ; and indeed , he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent .\",\n",
       " '\" And who is Admiral Croft ?\"',\n",
       " \"Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman ' s family , and mentioned a place ; and Anne , after the little pause which followed , added \",\n",
       " '\" He is a rear admiral of the white .',\n",
       " '\" Then I take it for granted ,\" observed Sir Walter , \" that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery .\"',\n",
       " 'Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him , that Admiral Croft was a very hale , hearty , well - looking man , a little weather - beaten , to be sure , but not much , and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour ; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms , only wanted a comfortable home , and to get into it as soon as possible ; knew he must pay for his convenience ; knew what rent a ready - furnished house of that consequence might fetch ; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more ; had inquired about the manor ; would be glad of the deputation , certainly , but made no great point of it ; said he sometimes took out a gun , but never killed ; quite the gentleman .',\n",
       " \"Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral ' s family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant .\",\n",
       " '\" And a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be ,\" continued he ; \" asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the Admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , Sir Walter , I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford .',\n",
       " 'But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot , that she did not hear the appeal .',\n",
       " '\" I have no conception whom you can mean , Shepherd ; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent .\"',\n",
       " '\" Bless me !',\n",
       " 'After waiting another moment ',\n",
       " '\" You mean Mr Wentworth , I suppose ?\"',\n",
       " 'Mr Shepherd was all gratitude .',\n",
       " '\" Wentworth was the very name !',\n",
       " '\" Wentworth ?',\n",
       " \"As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter ' s estimate of the dues of a tenant .\",\n",
       " 'It succeeded , however ; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house , and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms , he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty , and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft , who still remained at Taunton , and fix a day for the house being seen .',\n",
       " 'Sir Walter was not very wise ; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel , that a more unobjectionable tenant , in all essentials , than Admiral Croft bid fair to be , could hardly offer .',\n",
       " 'Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth : but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal , that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand ; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her .',\n",
       " 'Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act ; and no sooner had such an end been reached , than Anne , who had been a most attentive listener to the whole , left the room , to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks ; and as she walked along a favourite grove , said , with a gentle sigh , \" A few months more , and he , perhaps , may be walking here .\"',\n",
       " 'Chapter 4',\n",
       " 'He was not Mr Wentworth , the former curate of Monkford , however suspicious appearances may be , but a Captain Frederick Wentworth , his brother , who being made commander in consequence of the action off St Domingo , and not immediately employed , had come into Somersetshire , in the summer of 1806 ; and having no parent living , found a home for half a year at Monkford .',\n",
       " 'A short period of exquisite felicity followed , and but a short one .',\n",
       " 'Anne Elliot , with all her claims of birth , beauty , and mind , to throw herself away at nineteen ; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man , who had nothing but himself to recommend him , and no hopes of attaining affluence , but in the chances of a most uncertain profession , and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession , would be , indeed , a throwing away , which she grieved to think of !',\n",
       " 'Captain Wentworth had no fortune .',\n",
       " 'Such opposition , as these feelings produced , was more than Anne could combat .',\n",
       " \"A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance ; but not with a few months ended Anne ' s share of suffering from it .\",\n",
       " 'More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close ; and time had softened down much , perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him , but she had been too dependent on time alone ; no aid had been given in change of place ( except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture ), or in any novelty or enlargement of society .',\n",
       " \"They knew not each other ' s opinion , either its constancy or its change , on the one leading point of Anne ' s conduct , for the subject was never alluded to ; but Anne , at seven - and - twenty , thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen .\",\n",
       " 'How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been !',\n",
       " \"With all these circumstances , recollections and feelings , she could not hear that Captain Wentworth ' s sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain ; and many a stroll , and many a sigh , were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea .\",\n",
       " 'The sister , Mrs Croft , had then been out of England , accompanying her husband on a foreign station , and her own sister , Mary , had been at school while it all occurred ; and never admitted by the pride of some , and the delicacy of others , to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards .',\n",
       " 'With these supports , she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the Crofts , which , with Lady Russell , still resident in Kellynch , and Mary fixed only three miles off , must be anticipated , need not involve any particular awkwardness .',\n",
       " 'Chapter 5',\n",
       " \"On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft ' s seeing Kellynch Hall , Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell ' s , and keep out of the way till all was over ; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them .\",\n",
       " 'This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory , and decided the whole business at once .',\n",
       " 'The house and grounds , and furniture , were approved , the Crofts were approved , terms , time , every thing , and every body , was right ; and Mr Shepherd \\' s clerks were set to work , without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that \" This indenture sheweth .\"',\n",
       " 'Sir Walter , without hesitation , declared the Admiral to be the best - looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and the Admiral , with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park , \" I thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at Taunton .',\n",
       " 'The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas ; and as Sir Walter proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month , there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement .',\n",
       " 'Lady Russell , convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use , or any importance , in the choice of the house which they were going to secure , was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon , and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas ; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks , she was unable to give the full invitation she wished , and Anne though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath , and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country , did not think that , everything considered , she wished to remain .',\n",
       " 'Something occurred , however , to give her a different duty .',\n",
       " '\" I cannot possibly do without Anne ,\" was Mary \\' s reasoning ; and Elizabeth \\' s reply was , \" Then I am sure Anne had better stay , for nobody will want her in Bath .\"',\n",
       " 'To be claimed as a good , though in an improper style , is at least better than being rejected as no good at all ; and Anne , glad to be thought of some use , glad to have anything marked out as a duty , and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country , and her own dear country , readily agreed to stay .',\n",
       " \"This invitation of Mary ' s removed all Lady Russell ' s difficulties , and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her , and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge .\",\n",
       " \"So far all was perfectly right ; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan , when it burst on her , which was , Mrs Clay ' s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth , as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her .\",\n",
       " 'Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts ; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell .',\n",
       " 'She spoke , and seemed only to offend .',\n",
       " '\" Mrs Clay ,\" said she , warmly , \" never forgets who she is ; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , I can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people .',\n",
       " '\" There is hardly any personal defect ,\" replied Anne , \" which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to .\"',\n",
       " '\" I think very differently ,\" answered Elizabeth , shortly ; \" an agreeable manner may set off handsome features , but can never alter plain ones .',\n",
       " 'Anne had done ; glad that it was over , and not absolutely hopeless of doing good .',\n",
       " 'The last office of the four carriage - horses was to draw Sir Walter , Miss Elliot , and Mrs Clay to Bath .',\n",
       " 'Her friend was not in better spirits than herself .',\n",
       " \"Uppercross was a moderate - sized village , which a few years back had been completely in the old English style , containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers ; the mansion of the squire , with its high walls , great gates , and old trees , substantial and unmodernized , and the compact , tight parsonage , enclosed in its own neat garden , with a vine and a pear - tree trained round its casements ; but upon the marriage of the young ' squire , it had received the improvement of a farm - house elevated into a cottage , for his residence , and Uppercross Cottage , with its veranda , French windows , and other prettiness , was quite as likely to catch the traveller ' s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House , about a quarter of a mile farther on .\",\n",
       " 'Here Anne had often been staying .',\n",
       " '\" So , you are come at last !',\n",
       " '\" I am sorry to find you unwell ,\" replied Anne .',\n",
       " '\" Yes , I made the best of it ; I always do : but I was very far from well at the time ; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning : very unfit to be left alone , I am sure .',\n",
       " 'Anne said what was proper , and enquired after her husband .',\n",
       " '\" You have had your little boys with you ?\"',\n",
       " '\" Yes , as long as I could bear their noise ; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good .',\n",
       " '\" Well , you will soon be better now ,\" replied Anne , cheerfully .',\n",
       " '\" I can give you no account of them .',\n",
       " '\" You will see them yet , perhaps , before the morning is gone .',\n",
       " '\" I never want them , I assure you .',\n",
       " '\" My dear Mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself !',\n",

       " '\" A great many things , I assure you .',\n",

       " '\" I am very glad you were well enough , and I hope you had a pleasant party .\"',\n",
       " '\" Nothing remarkable .',\n",
       " \"A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Anne ' s side produced nearly a cure on Mary ' s .\",\n",
       " '\" Where shall we go ?\"',\n",
       " '\" I have not the smallest objection on that account ,\" replied Anne .',\n",
       " '\" Oh !',\n",
       " 'Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent ; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it , from believing that , though there were on each side continual subjects of offence , neither family could now do without it .',\n",
       " 'The Musgroves , like their houses , were in a state of alteration , perhaps of improvement .',\n",

       " 'Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits .',\n",
       " \"As to the management of their children , his theory was much better than his wife ' s , and his practice not so bad .\",\n",
       " 'One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties , and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house .',\n",
       " 'Mary \\' s declaration was , \" I hate sending the children to the Great House , though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them , for she humours and indulges them to such a degree , and gives them so much trash and sweet things , that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day .\"',\n",
       " 'She had this communication , moreover , from Mary .',\n",
       " \"Again , it was Mary ' s complaint , that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the Great House with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place .\",\n",
       " 'How was Anne to set all these matters to rights ?',\n",
       " 'In all other respects , her visit began and proceeded very well .',\n",
       " 'She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves , but having no voice , no knowledge of the harp , and no fond parents , to sit by and fancy themselves delighted , her performance was little thought of , only out of civility , or to refresh the others , as she was well aware .',\n",
       " 'The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company .',\n",

       " 'He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys , clinging to him like an old friend , and declaring he should not go ; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets , & c ., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun , Anne was left to persuade herself , as well as she could , that the same brother must still be in question .',\n",
       " 'The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage ; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot , the coach was beginning to be listened for , when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in .',\n",
       " '\" And I will tell you our reason ,\" she added , \" and all about it .',\n",
       " 'The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were , that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome , hopeless son ; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year ; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore ; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family , though quite as much as he deserved ; seldom heard of , and scarcely at all regretted , when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross , two years before .',\n",
       " 'He had , in fact , though his sisters were now doing all they could for him , by calling him \" poor Richard ,\" been nothing better than a thick - headed , unfeeling , unprofitable Dick Musgrove , who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name , living or dead .',\n",
       " \"He had been several years at sea , and had , in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable , and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of , been six months on board Captain Frederick Wentworth ' s frigate , the Laconia ; and from the Laconia he had , under the influence of his captain , written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence ; that is to say , the only two disinterested letters ; all the rest had been mere applications for money .\",\n",
       " 'In each letter he had spoken well of his captain ; but yet , so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters , so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships , that it had made scarcely any impression at the time ; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck , this very day , with a recollection of the name of Wentworth , as connected with her son , seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur .',\n",
       " 'She had gone to her letters , and found it all as she supposed ; and the re - perusal of these letters , after so long an interval , her poor son gone for ever , and all the strength of his faults forgotten , had affected her spirits exceedingly , and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death .',\n",
       " \"To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth , repeating his name so often , puzzling over past years , and at last ascertaining that it might , that it probably would , turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting , once or twice , after their coming back from Clifton  a very fine young man  but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago , was a new sort of trial to Anne ' s nerves .\",\n",
       " 'The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening .',\n",
       " 'Chapter 7',\n",
       " 'A very few days more , and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch , and Mr Musgrove had called on him , and come back warm in his praise , and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross , by the end of another week .',\n",
       " \"Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove ' s civility , and she was all but calling there in the same half hour .\",\n",
       " 'His collar - bone was found to be dislocated , and such injury received in the back , as roused the most alarming ideas .',\n",
       " \"Her brother ' s return was the first comfort ; he could take best care of his wife ; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary .\",\n",
       " 'The same story and the same raptures were repeated , when the two girls came with their father , through the gloom of the evening , to make enquiries ; and Mr Musgrove , no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir , could add his confirmation and praise , and hope there would be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off , and only be sorry to think that the cottage party , probably , would not like to leave the little boy , to give him the meeting .',\n",
       " 'Charles Musgrove , indeed , afterwards , shewed more of inclination ; \" the child was going on so well , and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth , that , perhaps , he might join them in the evening ; he would not dine from home , but he might walk in for half an hour .\"',\n",
       " 'The child had a good night , and was going on well the next day .',\n",

       " '\" I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother , but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick - room than Charles , for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if I told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about .',\n",
       " '\" But , could you be comfortable yourself , to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy ?\"',\n",
       " '\" Yes ; you see his papa can , and why should not I ?',\n",
       " '\" Well , if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself , suppose you were to go , as well as your husband .',\n",
       " '\" Are you serious ?\"',\n",
       " \"The next moment she was tapping at her husband ' s dressing - room door , and as Anne followed her up stairs , she was in time for the whole conversation , which began with Mary ' s saying , in a tone of great exultation \",\n",
       " '\" I mean to go with you , Charles , for I am of no more use at home than you are .',\n",
       " '\" This is very kind of Anne ,\" was her husband \\' s answer , \" and I should be very glad to have you go ; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself , to nurse our sick child .\"',\n",
       " 'Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause , and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him , where conviction was at least very agreeable , he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone , though he still wanted her to join them in the evening , when the child might be at rest for the night , and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her , but she was quite unpersuadable ; and this being the case , she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits .',\n",
       " 'She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting .',\n",

       " 'Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over .',\n",
       " '\" It is over !',\n",
       " 'Mary talked , but she could not attend .',\n",
       " 'Soon , however , she began to reason with herself , and try to be feeling less .',\n",

       " 'Now , how were his sentiments to be read ?',\n",
       " 'On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented , she was soon spared all suspense ; for , after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary : ',\n",

       " 'They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring ; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long , when they saw him coming after them , with three companions , all well known already , by description , to be Captain and Mrs Harville , and a Captain Benwick , who was staying with them .',\n",
       " 'Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia ; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him , on his return from Lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies .',\n",
       " '\" And yet ,\" said Anne to herself , as they now moved forward to meet the party , \" he has not , perhaps , a more sorrowing heart than I have .',\n",

       " 'They went back to dress and dine ; and so well had the scheme answered already , that nothing was found amiss ; though its being \" so entirely out of season ,\" and the \" no thoroughfare of Lyme ,\" and the \" no expectation of company ,\" had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn .',\n",
       " \"Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in Captain Wentworth ' s company than she had at first imagined could ever be , that the sitting down to the same table with him now , and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it ( they never got beyond ), was become a mere nothing .\",\n",
       " 'The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow , but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening ; and he came , bringing his friend also , which was more than had been expected , it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers .',\n",
       " \"While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to Anne ' s lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him .\",\n",
       " 'His looks shewing him not pained , but pleased with this allusion to his situation , she was emboldened to go on ; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind , she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study ; and on being requested to particularize , mentioned such works of our best moralists , such collections of the finest letters , such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering , as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts , and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances .',\n",
       " 'Captain Benwick listened attentively , and seemed grateful for the interest implied ; and though with a shake of the head , and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his , noted down the names of those she recommended , and promised to procure and read them .',\n",
       " 'When the evening was over , Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination .',\n",

       " 'Anne and Henrietta , finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning , agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast .',\n",
       " '\" Oh !',\n",
       " 'Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech , and entered into the subject , as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man , though here it was good of a lower standard , for what could be offered but general acquiescence ?',\n",

       " 'When they came to the steps , leading upwards from the beach , a gentleman , at the same moment preparing to come down , politely drew back , and stopped to give them way .',\n",
       " 'After attending Louisa through her business , and loitering about a little longer , they returned to the inn ; and Anne , in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining - room , had nearly run against the very same gentleman , as he came out of an adjoining apartment .',\n",
       " 'They had nearly done breakfast , when the sound of a carriage , ( almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme ) drew half the party to the window .',\n",

       " '\" Ah !\"',\n",
       " 'The Miss Musgroves agreed to it ; and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could , they returned to the breakfast table .',\n",
       " '\" Pray ,\" said Captain Wentworth , immediately , \" can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away ?\"',\n",
       " '\" Yes , Sir , a Mr Elliot , a gentleman of large fortune , came in last night from Sidmouth .',\n",

       " '\" This ,\" said she , \" is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an Italian love - song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give ; for I do not pretend to understand the language .',\n",

      "0 When the evening was over , Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination .\n",
      "1 The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow , but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening ; and he came , bringing his friend also , which was more than had been expected , it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers .\n",
      "2 \" No ,\" cried Anne , quickly , \" it cannot be Mr Elliot , I assure you .\n",
      "3 She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of .\n",
      "4 Captain Harville smiled , as much as to say , \" Do you claim that for your sex ?\"\n",
      "5 \" My expressions startle you .\n",

      "0 When the evening was over , Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination .\n",
      "1 The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow , but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening ; and he came , bringing his friend also , which was more than had been expected , it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers .\n",
      "2 \" No ,\" cried Anne , quickly , \" it cannot be Mr Elliot , I assure you .\n",
      "3 She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of .\n",
      "4 Captain Harville smiled , as much as to say , \" Do you claim that for your sex ?\"\n",
      "5 \" My expressions startle you .\n",
      "6 Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves , and their marriage , instead of depriving her of one friend , secured her two .\n",
      "7 \" I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two ; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine .\n",
      "8 Such were Elizabeth Elliot ' s sentiments and sensations ; such the cares to alloy , the agitations to vary , the sameness and the elegance , the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life ; such the feelings to give interest to a long , uneventful residence in one country circle , to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad , no talents or accomplishments for home , to occupy .\n",
